***Changes to Project Design (Extra Features):*** <br />
- Products/ Cart:
    - Add a “Hot feature”: show the products that have been bought frequently and recently
    - Split cart into two sections: the ‘regular cart’ where the total cost is calculated, and the ‘save for later’ section where users can save items without purchasing
- Inventory/ Order Fulfillment extra feature:
    - Add analytics showing sellers more details about the buyer: their ratings, number of messages
    - Ability to set alerts if inventory is will expire in  
    - Send a notification to sellers if an order is not fulfilled beyond 14 days/ a T+7 days
- Feedback/Messaging extra feature: 
    - Implement badges, notes next to reviewers that have made many review contributions, for certain reviewers.
    - The reasoning behind this feature being that such reviewers generally tend to leave more insightful reviews which are more helpful to shoppers. This is analogous to a recent feature implemented on Amazon that allows users to see which reviews are written by made by “top reviewers”.
- Account/ Purchases extra feature: 
    - Send authentication email to new users when they’re registering new accounts 
    - Send email to sellers when someone buys their products
